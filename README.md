# Real Time Pose Estimation using Mediapipe and OpenCV

## Introduction

Real-Time Pose Estimation is a computer vision application that uses the Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries to detect and track human poses in real-time video captured from a webcam. The project leverages deep learning techniques to predict the positions of various pose landmarks, providing a real-time visualization of human body configurations.

## Features

- Real-time pose detection and tracking from webcam feed.
- Visualization of pose landmarks with connecting lines for improved understanding.
- User-friendly interface for observing and analyzing detected human poses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Mediapipe (mediapipe)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start real-time pose estimation:

2. A window will open, showing the webcam feed with detected pose landmarks.

3. Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

- The project is based on the Mediapipe library by Google.
- Thanks to the creators and contributors of OpenCV for their powerful computer vision tools.
